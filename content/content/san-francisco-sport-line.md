TESTED ON SAN FRANCISCO'S LEGENDARY ROUTES

## Where We Put Every Piece to the Test

**Golden Gate Bridge Run**

Our team tested every piece running from Crissy Field to Sausalito and back. That 8-mile loop taught us what works when fog turns to sun mid-stride. The wind jacket you can stash. The tights with pockets deep enough for keys and phone. The fabric that dries before you're off the bridge.

**The Lyon Street Steps**

300+ steps of pure pain. We climbed them repeatedly testing fabrics under maximum effort. What we learned: compression matters, breathability isn't optional, and gear that works on stairs works everywhere.

**Lands End Coastal Trail**

Technical terrain, stunning views, unpredictable weather. This 3.4-mile trail showed us that trail running gear needs flexibility, durability, and style—because you're stopping for photos whether you planned to or not.

**Embarcadero Waterfront**

The classic SF run. Flat, fast, scenic, and always windy. This route proved that wind resistance makes the difference between a great run and a miserable slog. Our jackets block wind without overheating. That's the test.

PERFORMANCE MEETS PURPOSE

## Advanced Materials That Work Harder While Impacting Less

**Ocean Plastic Tech** – Every performance tee contains 8 recycled plastic bottles recovered from oceans. Same moisture-wicking technology, zero virgin plastic.

**Merino Miracle** – Ethically sourced merino wool regulates temperature, resists odor naturally, and biodegrades at end of life. Nature's original tech fabric.

**Durability Design** – Reinforced stitching, quality zippers, and fabrics that maintain performance after 100+ washes. Better longevity means less waste.

**Carbon Neutral** – Every item's carbon footprint calculated and offset. From production to shipping, we're accountable for our impact.

**Repair Program** – Bring worn pieces to our SF store for free repairs. Extend your gear's life while keeping it performing peak.

**Transparency** – Every product page shows: materials sourcing, factory info, environmental impact, and care instructions. No secrets, just facts.

LOCAL ATHLETES, REAL FEEDBACK

## Tested by SF's Outdoor Community

"I run the bridge 3x weekly. These jackets handle the wind without making me overheat on the climb. Plus, I can stuff it in my waistband when I warm up. Finally, functional AND thoughtful design."

**— Maya L., Presidio Heights** • Marathon Runner

"Surfing Ocean Beach means 50-degree water year-round. The quick-dry hoodies and board shorts are my go-to post-surf uniform. They look good enough for coffee but actually perform when wet and salty."

**— Carlos R., Outer Sunset** • Surfer & Lifeguard

"Old La Honda tests your gear as much as your legs. Climbing in these bibs, I stay comfortable on the grind and feel confident on the descent. No bunching, no overheating, just solid gear that disappears so I can focus on the ride."

**— Jennifer K., San Mateo** • Road Cyclist

"Mount Tam's trails are my weekend sanctuary. The hiking pants stretch when scrambling, resist abrasion on rocks, and still look good enough for the Mill Valley café after. Performance gear that doesn't scream 'I'm hiking!'"

**— David M., Berkeley** • Hiker & Climber

FIND YOUR PERFECT FIT

## Performance Sizing Designed for Movement

Our Active Collection uses athletic fits designed for movement. Expect closer cuts than casual wear but with strategic stretch for full range of motion.

**Tops (Tees, Long-sleeves, Base Layers)**

Slim Fit: Close to body for aerodynamics (cycling) and layering. Regular Fit: Comfortable for high-output activities (running, climbing). Size up if between sizes or prefer more room.

**Bottoms (Shorts, Tights, Pants)**

Performance Fit: Compression-inspired but not restrictive. Length Options: 5" and 7" inseams for shorts; 3/4 and full-length for tights. Waistbands designed to stay put during intense movement.

**Outerwear (Jackets, Vests, Hoodies)**

Athletic Cut: Room for layering without bulk. Packable Designs: Most jackets stuff into own pocket. Consider sizing up if you layer heavily.

**Still Unsure?** Visit our San Francisco store (1847 Market Street) for personal fitting. Our team includes athletes who live in this gear and can guide you to the perfect fit.
